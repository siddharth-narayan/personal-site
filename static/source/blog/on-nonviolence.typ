= On Vinland Saga and the Power Dynamics of Nonviolence

Just my (current) ideas on nonviolence and its relationship to power.

== For people who don't know the story
In Vinland Saga, Thorfinn, a child, promises to challenge the man that killed his father, Askeladd. He spends 13 years of his life _in service_ to Askeladd, furthering his goals, for the promise of revenge. Eventually, Askeladd is killed when he assasinates the king of Denmark, for complicated story reasons. The king is suceeded by his second son, Canute, who takes the throne by assasinating his brother. Thorfinn, who has now spent most of his childhood trying to challenge Askeladd to a duel by committing atrocities in his name, is devastated, both by the loss of most of his childhood in service to a person that killed his father, as well as the death of a person who had become a twisted version of a father to him.


For related reasons, Thorfinn is made a slave and ends up working on a farm. He meets a close friend, and fellow slave called Einar. He regrets the innocent (and not so innocent) people he's killed and hurt, and commits to never hurt another person.  

A few years later, the farm is under threat of takeover by the same monarchy, which needs resources. This escalates into a small scale conflict, before a ceasfire is called. During the ceasefire, which is about to end, Thorfinn confronts the invading army, and wants to speak to their leader, Canute, in an attempt to convince him not to invade the farm.

The guards refuse to allow him to speak, and Thorfinn must convince them he previously served as Canute's guard. As he refuses to leave, one of the guards attacks him, punching him repeatedly in the attempt to make him leave. Thorfinn sees they refuse to let him meet Canute, and challenges the man to punch him 100 times, that if he can survive those punches, they must let him meet Canute. Of course, the guards agree; they assume he's a random person unable to accomplish such a feat. When Thorfinn survives, however, they view him with respect. Thorfinn is asked why, if he was such a strong person, he did not simply challenge Drott to a fight in order to showcase his skill and prove himself as a warrior.

Thorfinn responds with the famous words: *"Well that's a dumb question to ask isn't it? It makes no sense to beat someone when you're trying to negotiate for peace. Especially since I just met you guys today ... It shouldn't be us; we've just met each other. And that means no one here is my enemy. Because, I have no enemies."*

A powerful message!
